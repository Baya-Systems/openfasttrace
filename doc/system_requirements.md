System Requirement Specification OpenFastTrack

# Introduction

## Terminology

  * OFT: OpenFastTrack (this project)
  * Specification item: holds either a requirement or coverage
  * Specification artifact: a data source containing specification items (e.g. file, ticket system,
    database)
  * Coverage requester: a specification item that need coverage
  * Coverage provider: a specification item that provides coverage

# Features
## Requirement Tracing
`feat~requirement_tracing~1` <a id="feat~requirement_tracing~1"></a>

OFT traces requirements from specification to any kind of coverage (document, implementation, test, etc.)

Needs: req

## Requirement Import
`feat~requirement_import~1` <a id="feat~requirement_import~1"></a>

OFT imports requirements from different text formats. The default is Markdown.

Needs: req

# High Level Requirements

## Forward Coverage Status
`req~forward_coverage_status~1` <a id="req~forward_coverage_status~1"></a>

OFT determines the forward coverage status of a requirement. "Forward" in this context means that the coverage is checked from the perspective of the item that needs to be covered.

The possible results are:

  1. OK:        a specification item requires coverage and is covered by one or more other specification items
  2. Uncovered: an specification item requires coverage but is not covered
  3. Outdated:  coverage exists but points to a lower revision number of the requester
  4. Predated:  coverage exists but points to a higher revision number of the requester

Covers:

  * [feat~requirement_tracing~1](#feat~requirement_tracing~1)

Needs: dsn

## Backward Coverage Status
`req~backward_coverage_status~1` <a id="req~backward_coverage_status~1"></a>

OFT determines the Backward coverage status of a requirement. "Backward" means that the links towards the requester are checked from the perspective of the item that provider.

The possible results are:

  1. Ok
  2. Unwanted:  the covered item exists (in any revision) but wants to be covered in a different artifact type
  3. Orphaned:  the provider claims to cover a non-existent requester
  4. Outdated:  the provider covers a lower revision number than the requester actually has
  5. Predated:  the provider covers a higher revision number than the requester actually has
  6. Ambiguous: the covered item has one or more duplicates (in any revision)

Covers:

  * [feat~requirement_tracing~1](#feat~requirement_tracing~1)

## Specification Item
`req~specification_item~1` <a id="req~specification_item~1"></a>

A specification item consists of the following parts:

  * ID
  * Title (optional)
  * Description
  * Rationale (optional)
  * Comment (optional)
  * Covers (optional)
  * Depends (optional)
  * Needs

The ID is a unique key through which the specification item can be referenced. It also contains the specification item type and revision number.

The title is a short summary of the specification item, mostly intended to appear in overview lists.

The description contains the normative part of the specification.

The rationale explains the reasoning behind a requirement or decision.

The "Covers" section contains a list of all specification items that are covered by this item.

The "Depends" section contains a list of all specification items that must be implemented in order
for this item to be complete.

The "Needs" section list all specification item types in which coverage for this item is needed.

## Input file selection
`req~input_file_selection~1` <a id="req~input_file_selection~1"></a>

Users select the input files either directly or indirectly via directories. In case users give directories, all files below each directory and sub-directories are used as input.

Rationale:

The 90% case will be scanning a single project directory and using the contents for tracing. There are scenarios though, where file lists generated by external tools need to be processed.

## Markdown Import
`req~markdown_import~1` <a id="req~markdown_import~1"></a>

OFT imports specification items from Markdown.

Rationale:

Markdown is a clean an simple format that:

  * is viewable with any text editor
  * focuses on content instead of layout
  * is portable across platforms
  * easy to process with text manipulation tools
  
For those reasons Markdown is a suitable candidate for writing specification that can be read and
maintained over a long time.

Covers:

  * [feat~requirement_import~1](#feat~requirement_import~1)

### Markdown Standard syntax
`req~markdown_standard_syntax~1` <a id="req~markdown_standard_syntax~1"></a>

The OFT Markdown specification artifact format uses the standard markdown syntax without proprietary extensions.

Rationale:

The specification documents that the OFT Markdown importer reads must be viewable with any regular Markdown reader and as plain text.

Covers:

  * [feat~requirement_import~1](#feat~requirement_import~1)

Needs: dsn

### Markdown Outline Readable
The Markdown outline -- a table of contents created from the heading structure by various Markdown editors -- must be human readable.

Rationale:

In long specification document the outline is the primary means of navigating the document. Only if the outline can be read easily, it is useful for authoring specification documents.
